# Train-Stations-in-Singapore
This repository is part of **IS216 G1T8** TravelSG group project. The **interactiveMap.html** and **originalTrainMap.html** webpages are used within the TravelSG MRT webpage.

The website shows the map of Singapore with all the MRT and LRT stations available. In **interactiveMap.html**, Leaflet is used to render a map with custom markers to match the MRT Lines. Meanwhile, **originalTrainMap.html** is to display the MRT map from Land Transport Authority (LTA) Singapore as a static image.
