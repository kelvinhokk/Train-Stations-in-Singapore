# Train-Stations-in-Singapore
This is part of **IS216 G1T8** TravelSG group project. This repository is a sub-repository to https://github.com/MrTaooo/G1T8. The **interactiveMap.html** and **originalTrainMap.html** webpages are used within the main TravelSG MRT webpage.

The website shows the map of Singapore with all the MRT and LRT stations available. In **interactiveMap.html**, LeafletJS library is used to render a map with custom markers to match the MRT Lines. The **TrainStation.js** file contains the map marker coordinates for all MRT and LRT stations in GeoJSON format. The data was from LTA Datamall 'Train Station' Static Dataset (https://datamall.lta.gov.sg/content/datamall/en/static-data.html) and further processed and edited to suit our project web application. Meanwhile, **originalTrainMap.html** is to display the MRT map from Land Transport Authority (LTA) Singapore as a static image.
