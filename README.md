# Train-Stations-in-Singapore
This repository is for a school group project. The website shows the map of Singapore with all the MRT and LRT stations available. In interactiveMap.html, Leaflet is used to render the map with custom markers to match the different MRT Lines. Meanwhile, originalTrainMap.html is to display the MRT map from SMRT as a static image.
