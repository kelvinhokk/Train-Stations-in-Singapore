# Train-Stations-in-Singapore
This repository is part of IS216 G1T8 TravelSG group project. The website shows the map of Singapore with all the MRT and LRT stations available. In interactiveMap.html, Leaflet is used to render a map with custom markers to match the MRT Lines. Meanwhile, originalTrainMap.html is to display the MRT map from Land Transport Authority (LTA) Singapore as a static image.
